### About Me
I have been working as illustrator for the past few years/ However, I experienced a complete burnout, and realized I could not stand such a working environment anymore. So, I decided to pursue my career in web development. Here I am at Rs School ready to study Front End.
My core strengths are planning skills, fast learning and patience.
